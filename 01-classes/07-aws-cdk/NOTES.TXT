#06 CLOUD FORMATION
	Create automatized processes using templates
	Allow store tenplates into containers
	Allow the versionament of theses containers

- Step by step
	Create a template using JSON or YAML
	Send the template to CloudFormation
	New stacks are created to handle the resources needed
	New resources are created under the stack

- Template
	Define the resource, properties, metadata, settings

#07 Stacks
	Used to organize resources
	Stacks can be created, updated, and deleted
	Stack changes reflect in its resources
	Stacks can be ccreated by resources or for the whole project

- Stack events
	It's like a checkpoint that indicates the running procress status
	It indicates the point of fails and issues

- Stack Resources
	Resources related to stack

- Stack Parameters
	The creation of stack and resources can be customized by parameters
	These parameters can define properties like the amount of physical hardware allocated

- Deleting Stacks
	When deleting a stack all resources are deleted


#09 AWS Cloud Development Kit
	AWS Construct library
	Framework for the AWS Cloud Development
	Can be used with Jenkins or AWS CodePipeline

- Step by step
	Install AWS CDK.
	Create a resource using a programming language
	These resources will be transformed into CloudFormation templates

#14 E-comerce app
- Start a new project
	cdk init --language typescript

- Structure
	.bin/	create an instance of a stack
	.lib/	define new stacks and resources

- New Libs
	npm i aws-sdk @types/aws-lambda @types/uuid -D

- CDK commands
	cdk list
	show stacks instances (./bin)

	cdk deploy --all
	create resources and deploy stacks

	cdk diff
	compare AWS stacks with Local stacks

	cdk destroy --all
	remove all stacks

#15 AWS Lambda
	Trigger functions called by events
	More that one funtion can run at the same time
	The cust is calculated based on the execution time and resource used
	CloudWatch: show logs from lambda functions
	X-Ray: show the execution time for each piece of the lambda function
